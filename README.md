**Layer L1 — Foundation** of the [UniERP](https://github.com/kannan19302/unierp-platform) platform.
Depends on: the design system.

## What this is

The Storybook workshop for `@kannan19302/ui`.

## The invariant this repository owns

Documents the design system; never a place for product code.

## The rule that applies everywhere

A repository may depend only on published artifacts of a **strictly lower
layer** — never sideways within a layer, never upward. A cycle is not
discouraged; it is unrepresentable, because the lower layer's package cannot
name the higher one.

See the [platform overview](https://github.com/kannan19302/unierp-platform) for the full map, and
[`PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/kannan19302/unierp-workspace) § 4.2 for
the reasoning.
